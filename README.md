# Static Site Generator
This is a guided project on the boot.dev site. It comes with 2 example markdown files that the generator will turn into html files.
  
Supported markdown syntax:
* headers
* links
* images
* bold
* italic
* code
* blockquotes
* code blocks
* unordered lists
* ordered lists

Specifically not supported:
* nested syntax (like italic in bold)

To use it:
* clone the project `https://github.com/Zelieen/StaticSiteGenerator.git`
* run ./main.sh from the root of the project
* open a browser on http://localhost:8888 to see the generated content.

Customize by changing the markdown files (and directories) inside the content directory
